# pmtiles CLI

## CLI Overview

### Remote archives

Remote buckets are specified in the CLI via URLS. Commands are similar to:

```
pmtiles [COMMAND] [KEY] --bucket=[PROTOCOL]://[BUCKET_NAME]
```

The bucket URL can contain query parameters like:

* `endpoint`: If not using AWS, an S3-compatible HTTPS endpoint.
* `region`: a provider-specific region string, such as `us-west-2` for AWS, and `auto` for all Cloudflare regions.

Example of reading from a private Cloudflare R2 bucket:

Since this command uses URL characters like `?` and `&`, those **must be escaped** by a backslash `\`.

```sh
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=MY_KEY
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=MY_SECRET
pmtiles show NAME.pmtiles --bucket=s3://R2_BUCKET_NAME\?endpoint=https://R2_ACCOUNT_ID.r2.cloudflarestorage.com\&region=auto
```

Note that S3-compatible storage servers like Minio, Ceph and SeaweedFS may require [additional URL options](https://gocloud.dev/howto/blob/#s3-compatible) like `s3ForcePathStyle=true`.

## Commands

### show

```bash
pmtiles show INPUT.pmtiles
```

Print an archive's header data and metadata.

### tile

```bash
pmtiles tile INPUT.pmtiles 0 0 0
```

Output a single tile to stdout.

### verify

```bash
pmtiles verify INPUT.pmtiles
```

Check that an archive is ordered correctly and has correct header information.

### extract

```bash
pmtiles extract INPUT.pmtiles OUTPUT.pmtiles --bbox=MIN_LON,MIN_LAT,MAX_LON,MAX_LAT
pmtiles extract INPUT.pmtiles OUTPUT.pmtiles --region=REGION.geojson
```

Create a smaller archive from a larger archive. The source archive may be local or remote. The source archive must be clustered.

Options:

* `--maxzoom`: Extract only a subset of zoom levels. Extracting a full sub-pyramid from 0 to `maxzoom` is always an efficient operation that makes minimal I/O or network requests to the source archive.
* `--minzoom`: Extract only a partial sub-pyramid. This may require many more requests than leaving the default `--minzoom=0`. Because this removes overview zoom levels, it should only be used in specific situations.

### serve

```bash
pmtiles serve .
pmtiles serve . --bucket=https://example.com
pmtiles serve / --bucket=s3://BUCKET_NAME
```

Expose Z/X/Y tile URLS, e.g. `/mymap/{z}/{x}/{y}.mvt`, for a directory or bucket of archives. **Requests for the raw file e.g. `mymap.pmtiles` will not work.**

A Z/X/Y URL like  is directly supported by web and native clients such as [MapLibre](http://maplibre.org), without needing the PMTiles client library. Using `pmtiles serve` this way also allows serving public Z/X/Y traffic from private storage buckets.

### convert

```bash
pmtiles convert INPUT.mbtiles OUTPUT.pmtiles
```

Convert from MBTiles.

### version

```bash
pmtiles version
```

Print the version of the command line tool.
