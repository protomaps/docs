# Basemap Flavors

These examples use the preferred [MapLibre GL JS](/basemaps/maplibre) library.

The `Flavor` TypeScript interface is the preferred way to customize the basemap style. See the shape of the interface at the [@protomaps/basemaps TypeScript docs](https://maps.protomaps.com/typedoc/interfaces/Flavor.html).

A `Flavor` is a plain object of color definitions and optional properties such as font names, landcover shades and POI properties. You can define a `Flavor` yourself for a custom style, similar to a text editor color scheme, or use one of the default named flavors as a base.

## Default Flavors

These flavors are included as part of the `@protomaps/basemaps` package.

### light

A general-purpose basemap with icons.

<MaplibreMap flavor="light" :zoom=13 :lat="51.509" :lng="-0.14"/>

### dark

A general-purpose basemap with icons.

<MaplibreMap flavor="dark" :zoom=13 :lat="51.509" :lng="-0.14"/>

### white

A flavor for data visualization.

<MaplibreMap flavor="white" :zoom=13 :lat="51.509" :lng="-0.14"/>

### grayscale

A flavor for data visualization.

<MaplibreMap flavor="grayscale" :zoom=13 :lat="51.509" :lng="-0.14"/>

### black

A flavor for data visualization.

<MaplibreMap flavor="black" :zoom=13 :lat="51.509" :lng="-0.14"/>

## Overriding Defaults

Use [ES6 spread syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax) to override any part of the Flavor object. For example, to color buildings red:

```ts
import { namedFlavor } from "@protomaps/basemaps"
let flavor = {...namedFlavor("light"),buildings:"red"}
```

## Sprites

### Default Sprites

Each of the five default Flavors has an associated spritesheet. Sprites are necessary for displaying:

* Townspots - circles for cities and named places at low zoom levels.
* Highway shields - Shields are localized for different countries and road classes. See [shields](layers#shields).
* Points of interest - used for the `light` and `dark` flavors only.

Spritesheets are designed according to the [MapLibre Sprite specification](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-style-spec/sprite/). Because these sprites are stored in a static PNG image, the colors are pre-rendered to match the associated basemap Flavor.

A spritesheet can be generated by building the program in [basemaps/sprites](https://github.com/protomaps/basemaps/tree/main/sprites):

```sh
cargo build # creates the binary target/release/spritegen
make # builds all 5 default flavor spritesheets in dist/
# Create a new JSON in flavors/custom.json and customize the colors...
./target/release/spritegen refill.svg flavors/custom.json dist/custom
```

### Custom Sprites

A custom spritesheet (`custom.json`, `custom.png`, `custom@2x.json`, `custom@2x.png`) can be referenced from a [MapLibre JSON style](maplibre):

```js
sprite: "https://example.com/assets/custom"
```

Sprites can be replaced with custom sets by assigning new icons to the same sprite names. Sprite names can be found in [light.json](https://github.com/protomaps/basemaps/blob/main/sprites/flavors/light.json):

```csv
townspot
capital
arrow
generic_shield-1char
...
```

To generate a spritesheet with a sigle icon based on the CC0 [Maki icon set created by Mapbox](https://github.com/mapbox/maki), use the [spreet](https://github.com/flother/spreet) command line tool:

```sh
mv airport.svg icons/aerodrome.svg
spreet icons output
# creates output.json and output.png
spreet --retina icons output@2x
#creates output@2x.json and output@2x.png, used on HiDPI displays
```
