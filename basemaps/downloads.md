# Basemap Downloads

## Intro

The **Protomaps Basemap** is a general purpose vector *base map* - city labels, roads, water features and other essential location context derived from [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org). It's available as a single PMTiles archive, distributed as an [Open Database License](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/) Produced Work (OpenStreetMap attribution required)

## Current Version

The Version 3 Protomaps basemap daily build channel is available at [maps.protomaps.com/builds](https://maps.protomaps.com/builds).

## Previous Version

The version 2 basemap is `protomaps-basemap-opensource-20230408.pmtiles`

The [protomaps-leaflet](https://github.com/protomaps/protomaps-leaflet) Leaflet plugin currently uses this basemap version.

You can download the planet archive at this link (âš  file is over 100GB):

Please note that this **URL may change** and hotlinking to it is discouraged. Instead, you should copy the tileset to your own [Cloud Storage](/pmtiles/cloud-storage).
